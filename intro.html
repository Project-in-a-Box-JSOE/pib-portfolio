  ## Introduction to Web Development: Meet Page

  [<< Previous Lesson](setup.html)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;[Next Lesson >>](lesson-htmlcss-1.html)

  Websites are generally composed of the golden trio of
  HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  A good way of remembering what each does
  is by comparing a web page to a person.

  - A Person has a frame holding them up loosely (**HTML**)
  - And each person has their own creative, specific, style (**CSS**)
  - And finally, people interact with things and respond when spoken to (**Javascript**)

  The structure of a website isn't so different from that of your average human friend. It has a skeleton, a distinguishable style, and ideally a lot of fun under-the-hood features that make interacting with it a joy and not a chore.
  Let's meet Page.

  <img src="images/Page.jpg" alt="Page" style="width: 25%; height: 25%">

  As you can see, Page is stylish and well-maintained. She's a great lecturer and presents her arguments in a structured, concise manner. If you want her to be more than a face in the crowd, Page is interactive - you could even potentially chat with her, play a game of chess, or ask her to direct you to some of her friends.

  Like Page, an actual webpage should have all of the above attributes by implementation through **CSS**, **HTML**, and **JavaScript**, respectively.
  Let's dive into web development.
