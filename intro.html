  ## Introduction to Web Development: Meet Page

  [<< Previous Lesson](setup.html)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;[Next Lesson >>](lesson-htmlcss-1.html)

  Websites are generally composed of the golden trio of
  HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  A good way of remembering what each does
  is by comparing a web page to a person.

  - A Person has a frame holding them up loosely (**HTML**)
  - And each person has their own creative, specific, style (**CSS**)
  - And finally, people interact with things and respond when spoken to (**Javascript**)

  Let's meet Page.

  <img src="images/Page.jpg" alt="Page" style="width: 25%; height: 25%">

  Page is a graduating ucsd student who wants to create a web portfolio to showcase
  her projects.

  In this portion of web development lesson, you will create your very own
  web portfolio along with Page.
