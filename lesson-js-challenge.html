Halloween is coming up as I am currently writing this.
Giving that javascript is magically "breathing life"
and "stitching" together elements, the following
challenge will be named The Frankenstein Challenge.

##The Goal:
You will be stitching together the frankenstein picture with 6 given pictures.
Additionally, when you click on a body part, it should
print out which body part is clicked.
Bonus: It should be able to move its arms and dance.

1. Generate 9 boxes that represent left arm, right arm, body, and legs.  The pictures are given
   in the "img" folder.  Resolve the 6 picture to 9 boxes problem.
2. Each click on the Box, allow you to change the Headlines to the clicked box's content,
   to represent each arm clicked


##The Concepts:
- Variables
- Loops
- Dom Manipulating
- Functions
- String Manipulation
- Css Knowledge
