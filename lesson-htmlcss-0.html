  ### HTML:  How everything works together
  ___
  ####Lesson 1: Raising Your First Skeleton

  Every HTML document requires a starter template that allows your file to be recognized as a web page. Take a look at the following:

  ```
  <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>
      </body>
  </html>```

  Let's decipher these tags.

  ___

  ####Single Use Tags

  * `<!DOCTYPE html>` **tells the web broswer that the document will be in HTML. This line of code MUST be in the first line of code in all of your HTML documents.**

  * `<html>` **and its closing tag at the end of the file, `</html>` are used to inform the browser that the lines in between those two lines are HTML code.** You can view this tag as a *vertebrate* of sorts, connecting and unifying all the smaller components of the file.

  * `<head>` **Content between head tags doesn’t show up as information that is shown on the web page. It is used in order to tell the web browser information about the page, such as the title and other files like stylesheets (CSS) and scripts (JavaScript) that are linked to the page.** Think about how your actual head encompasses your brain, a deep and rich well of knowledge that isn't externally apparent.

  * `<title>` **Content between this and it’s ending tag are not displayed on the website itself, but are shown on the title bar.** Consider this your web page's nice (optional) head of hair.

  * `<body>` **Visible content is displayed between this tag and it’s ending tag. Content that you want to appear on your website goes in the body section.** All your bones go in here!


  ####Multi-Use Tags

  * `<h1>` In this tag, the text “My First Heading” is shown. Browsers view the &lt;h1&gt; tag as a heading tag to display large text over a section. &lt;h2&gt; through &lt;h6&gt; tags likewise exist, getting smaller in default size as they increase numerically.

  * `<p>` Within this tag, the text “My first paragraph” is shown. Browsers view the &lt;p&gt; tag as a paragraph tag to display paragraph text within a section.

  ___

  Of these, &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt; are **block** elements, meaning that their usage will force a new line to occur, while such tags as image and link tags are referred to as **inline** statements, meaning that all subsequent statements will be in the same line until a block element is reached. For a more comprehensive list of both types of elements, check out [this](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp) page.

  Pretty simple stuff, right? HTML elements consist of tags surrounded by angle brackets <> that denote what is going to be used between the opening tag <> and the closing tag </>. See the webpage for this HTML [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_intro).

  Take the first step towards creating your own personal portfolio - content! Add headers and subheaders, a descriptive paragraph, a picture of yourself, and lists of your skills, work experience, and projects. Add all of this inside the appropriate tags.
