# Final-Project: To-Do List

[<< Previous Lesson](lesson-js-challenge.html)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;[Next Lesson >>](lesson-js-3.html)

#### Part 3: Server Code
Let's start the server code
First, set up the server to serve code on the route.
If you forgot, feel free to refer back to the [server tutorial](lesson-js-3.html)
Everything from Part 1 and 2 should still be seen on localhost:8080


Check Point:
[ Show Image of evidence of local host ]


Now, its time to get a mongodb server running.
Go to [mlab.com](https://mlab.com) and set up an account, and get the
user password.
[ Show Image of Information ]


Given that, its time to download the packages.
npm install mongodb --save
Here are the steps needed
1. Get Mongo Client
2. Authenticate your Credentials and connect with database
3. Attach a database "Post Call" and get a request testing (Post Man)
4. Allow your front-end code to make a request to server (a POST request)
5. Test Routes w/ PostMan

[ Show all code as skeletons ]

Here's what the completed code looks like:
```javascript
    var express = require('express');
    var app = express();
    var path = require('path');

    const port = process.env.PORT || 8080;

    /* Setting up Mongo client */

    const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
    var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
    var morgan = require('morgan');


    MongoClient.connect('mongodb://pibtuts:pibtutswutsup321@ds147900.mlab.com:47900/mobewash',
    (err, database) => {
      if (err) return console.log(err)
      else {
        console.log("Connected With DB");
        db = database;
        app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true}));
        app.use(bodyParser.json());
        app.use(morgan('dev'));
      }
    });

    app.use("/", express.static(path.join(__dirname, ''))); // Serve static files
    app.get('/', function(req, res){
      res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname + '/index.html'));
    });

    app.route('/task')
    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log('listening on port')
    });
```

Our Next step will be setting up the routes
Recall the operations:

- GET  - Get all the available tasks
- POST - Add a New Task
- PUT  - Update a previous Task
- DELETE - Delete a Saved Task (Complete a Task)

First, in order to do anything, we need data in our database.
We will save our task items in a container in the database called a
"collection."  Note that the message is hardcoded for now.

```
    app.post("/task", function(req, res){
        var message = {
           message: "Harcoded Task!  Will be the same!"
           // TO BE DONE : Replace the above with req.body.__name__of__variable
         }

        db.collection('tasks').save( message, (err, result) => {
            if (err) return console.log(err);
            console.log('saved to database')
            res.send(result);
        });
    }
```

Breaking the above down, when someone sends a request POST at your
url with the route "task", and give you a message, you extract
that message in the "request" object named "req." "res" stands for
response, and that is why you have the option of sending back
something (in this case, we sent back the result of what we added to
the database).


However, you'll need to be able to send that request, which we haven't
covered yet.  That request is sent on the client side, on the website.
Pull up script.js and add the following:
```
    var postTask = (task)=> {
      $.ajax({
        url: '/task', // Notice that the route is the one we just set!
        data: { message: task }, // We've named the variable message
        type: 'POST'
      }).done((data)=>{
        /* Needed */
        console.log(data); //
      });
    }

    /* TO BE FILLED BY YOU: Grab the add button dom, and fix the above function to its on-click event
     * You should get all your tasks when you click on the big red add button




     */

```
The above postTask function essentially sends a POST request to your /task route
on the website you currently are on. This triggers the serverside piece of code we
wrote just a few moments ago, which should add it to your database.
If you go to your mongolab, you should be able to see the changes.



Part 4: Text Message your tasks!
Reading official docs is good practice for real-world tasks, so
for the last piece of code, its up to you to combine everything.
The final feature will be you being able to schedule a text to yourself!

Time to set up a Twilio, and then schedule a job!
Go to [Twilio](twilio.com) and set up an account, and npm install the modules

Install 2 modules:
```
    npm install node-schedule twilio --save
```


Read how to use their modules below:  <br>
[*Twilio*](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/09/how-to-send-an-sms-with-node-js-using-twilio.html) <br>
[*Job Scheduler*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-schedule)

The last exercise will involve a lot of reading, and a little bit of logic. <br>
Only refer to the solution code if you absolutely cannot figure out.


#### \*Hint* Only do this after you've completed both readings, attempted the problem,
and are still stumped

###Algorithm: <br>

0. Configure settings for Twilio with your API
1. Schedule a job - Test this by using a test route and a POST request
    - a good test is to just have your server print out something
2. Write another POST request route ("text") and test your Twilio Code
3. Merge the twilio code within the job scheduling code, using only one route

Finally, feel free to embed this into your portfolio site
to show off your cool inventions!
