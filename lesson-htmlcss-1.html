  ## HTML/CSS Exercises: Part One

  What is HTML? HTML is an abbreviation for **Hyper Text Markup Language**. It is a markup language that browsers read to determine the structure and organization of a web page. Think of HTML as the frame to your webpage house, or as the skeleton to your webpage body.

  HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages and are denoted by tags such as **&lt;html&gt;**, **&lt;head&gt;**, **&lt;body&gt;**, **&lt;p&gt;**, etc. Using these building blocks, you will be able to organize content on your portfolio.

  ####Lesson 1: Raising Your First Skeleton

  Every HTML document requires a starter template that allows your file to be recognized as a web page. Take a look at the following:

  ```
  <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>
      </body>
  </html>```

  Let's decipher these tags.

  ####Single Use Tags

  `<!DOCTYPE html>` **tells the web broswer that the document will be in HTML. This line of code MUST be in the first line of code in all of your HTML documents.** 

  `<html>` **and its closing tag at the end of the file, `</html>` are used to inform the browser that the lines in between those two lines are HTML code.** You can view this tag as a *vertebrate* of sorts, connecting and unifying all the smaller components of the file. 

  `<head>` **Content between head tags doesn’t show up as information that is shown on the web page. It is used in order to tell the web browser information about the page, such as the title and other files like stylesheets (CSS) and scripts (JavaScript) that are linked to the page.** Think about how your actual head encompasses your brain, a deep and rich well of knowledge that isn't externally apparent.
  
  `<title>` **Content between this and it’s ending tag are not displayed on the website itself, but are shown on the title bar.** Consider this your web page's nice (optional) head of hair.

  `<body>` **Visible content is displayed between this tag and it’s ending tag. Content that you want to appear on your website goes in the body section.** All your bones go in here!

  ####Multi-Use Tags

  `<h1>` In this tag, the text “My First Heading” is shown. Browsers view the &lt;h1&gt; tag as a heading tag to display large text over a section. &lt;h2&gt; through &lt;h6&ht; tags likewise exist, getting smaller in default size as they increase numerically.

  `<p>` Within this tag, the text “My first paragraph” is shown. Browsers view the &lt;p&gt; tag as a paragraph tag to display paragraph text within a section.

  Pretty simple stuff, right? HTML elements consist of tags surrounded by angle brackets <> that denote what is going to be used between the opening tag <> and the closing tag </>. See the webpage for this HTML [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_intro).
