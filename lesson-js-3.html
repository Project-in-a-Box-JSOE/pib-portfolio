  ## Juggling Javascript: Part Three

[<< Previous Lesson](lesson-js-challenge-2.html)&nbsp;&nbsp;

  The final lesson will go deeper into web development,
  using technologies from both the front and backend.
  First, we'll cover how exactly the internet works,
  and how the technology we'll learn ties into internet.

  We'll decrypt some terms like "Front-End" and "Back-End"
  as it pertains to the web.


  I like to think about how the web works as how a mobile food truck works.

  Inherent in the world-wide web is a flow of data, and several
  posts that intercept the data.  There are protocols and standards,
  but a really simple way of thinking about it is imagining it as a food
  truck.

  There's a storefront that takes all your requests, and makes their own
  requests, goes to the kitchen in the back to parse your request (order),
  which the chef and crew decides  how to server you your meal (content).

  In this scenario, you have servers that server content (data).

  To get started, and really drive in the different between
  server code and browser code, its time to write up some server code.

  Your tools today will be node.
