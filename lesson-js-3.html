  ## Juggling Javascript: Part Three

[<< Previous Lesson](lesson-js-challenge-2.html)&nbsp;&nbsp;

The final lesson will go deeper into web development,
using technologies from both the front and backend.
First, we'll cover how exactly the internet works,
and how the technology we'll learn ties into internet.


I like to think about how the web works as how a mobile food truck works.
In the world-wide web is a flow of data, and several
points that intercept the data.

In terms of the food truck example, there's a storefront that takes all your requests, and makes their own
requests (browser), and the person that goes to the kitchen in the back to parse your request (order),
which the chef and crew (backend/server) interprets how to server you your meal (content),
does things, and sends it to the storefront (browser), which wraps it up and gives you your meal.

You have already written the content (front-end code) in the previous lessons.
In this lesson, you will write server code that will interpret responses
and serve or manipulate that content.

We will be using node.js, an open source cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for servers and applications,
and since it is in javascript we can utilize everything we've learned so far.
Download and install node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) <br>
To check if node is installed, run
```
    node -v
    npm -v
```

After a successful install, the current versions should be printed.
These commands will run any server script you want it to.

Alright, time to checkout some starter code:

```
    git checkout js-server
```


First, study the code at index.js.  This is your server code
```javascript

  /* Part 1: Bringing in Modules */
  var express = require('express');
  var app = express();               // Creates a server

  const port = process.env.PORT || 8080;   // Setting up Variables

  var path = require('path');
  app.use("/", express.static(path.join(__dirname, ''))); // Serve static files


  /* Part 2: Define Routes */
  app.get('/', function(req, res){
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname + '/index.html'));
  });

  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log('listening on port')
  });
```
Breaking the above down, the *require* statements grab code modules
that have functions that you can use.

Express is web application framework that we can use to create servers.
Once we bring it in with the require statement, we call express()
as a function to start a server instance and attach it to a variable called app,
where we can define its routes and how it responds to requests.
```javascript
  var express = require('express');
  var app = express();               // Creates a server

```

However, to use the "express" module, you first have to download it.
Node Package Manager, or "npm", makes it easy to do so.
Type in "npm install express --save"

Next, we are going to define some configurations for your server.
```javascript
  const port = process.env.PORT || 8080;   // Setting up Variables
  var path = require('path');
  app.use("/", express.static(path.join(__dirname, ''))); // Serve static files
```

We are defining the port your web app will listen to for requests.
Then, we are grabbing the path module and using it to
configure our server to serve our css files and images (our "static" files).
The final step is to define how to actually handle the requests that come in

```javascript
    app.get('/', function(req, res){
      res.send("Echoed into the void!");
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log('listening on port')
    });
```

"/" is your root directory, and by assigning ".get," we are defining
how the server should respond to get requests.  Additionally, your web server
will listen on the port you defined earlier with "const port = ..."
Recall that ports are how your computer interacts with the world wide web.

Open up your browser and type in "localhost:8000"
You should see the message "Echoed into the void";
<br/>


However, we don't want to send a message, we want to send our entire
webpage. All that's left is to copy your index.html files and css files
to the directory, and make ammends to this piece of code.
```javascript
    app.get('/', function(req, res){
      res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname + '/index.html'));
    });
```

Run your code with ```node index.js ``` <br>
And then go to localhost:8080 again. <br>
If you see the content you've created, then congratulations,
you have set up a web server!
