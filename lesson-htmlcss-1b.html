### HTML: Hello to Markup Languages
#### Attributes

Now that you can vaguely recognize the different flavors of HTML tags, how about the different **attributes**? Attributes are always specified within the start tag and are used to provide additional information about an element. Keep in mind that attributes usually come in name/value pairs in a format such that name="value".

Attributes can be split into two categories:

* **required**, in which the attribute MUST be declared within the tag in order for the tag to fulfill its purpose
  * The [**href**](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_attributes_link) attribute within &lt;a&gt; tags, which are used to create HTML *links*, is a prime example of this
  * The [**src**](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_attributes_img) attribute within an &lt;img&gt; tag is also required in order for one to use an *image* on their webpage
  
* **optional**, where attribute inclusion provides different information about an element but is not necessary
  * The [**title**](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_attributes_title) attribute functions to provide tooltip text for an element when hovered over
  * The [**alt**](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_attributes_alt) attribute allows you to display some alternate text when an image cannot be displayed. This attribute can prove particularly useful for the blind, who use screen readers to read webpages, and will read the 'alt' value where the image is placed.
  * [**size**](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_attributes_img) attributes 'width' and 'height' allow you to play with the size of an image.

In short, attributes, when not absolutely necessary, can add some pretty nifty functionality and even some trivial styling without invoking CSS. IDs and Classes are important attributes that allow you to style with CSS, but we'll get to those more in the next lesson.

For a more complete list of attributes, check out this [HTML Attribute Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp).

Add a picture of yourself, animated, actual, or otherwise to your webpage! Worry about positioning later. You can choose to either connect your image from an online URL or from a file within your local repository. Once you've finished, your page should look something like below.([HTML Image Reference Page](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp))

<img src="images/html-page-2.png" alt="Example HTML in Browser with Picture" style="height: 50%; width: 50%; border: solid;">

<span style="color:red">Bonus Challenge 2A: </span> Referencing the above lesson, add (a) 'title' and (b) 'alt' attributes to your image and (c) change its size.

#### HTML Pointers and More

Here are some other handy tags that make styling a whole lot easier:

  * **&lt;br&gt;** creates a new line
  * **&lt;div&gt;** tags create a new block section that attributes can be applied to
  * **&lt;span&gt;** tags create a new inline section that attributes can be applied to

  * **&lt;b&gt;** tags make text **bold**
  * **&lt;i&gt;** tags *italicize* text
  * **&lt;mark&gt;** tags can be used to <mark>highlight</mark> text
  * **&lt;del&gt;** tags can be used to <del>strikethrough</del> text

Pretty simple stuff, right? HTML elements consist of tags surrounded by angle brackets <> that denote what is going to be used between the opening tag <> and the closing tag </>. See the webpage for the HTML [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_intro).

#### <span style="color:red">Challenge #3: What's on the Menu</span> <br>
One feature within a number of well-organized, user-friendly webpages is a navigation bar. Building off of what we learned in the 'Attributes' section, let's introduce a new attribute to our repertoire of knowledge.

The **id** attribute specifies a unique ID for an HTML element. When declaring an ID name for an element, the name must contain at least one character, no space characters, and is inherently case-insensitive.

We are going to use the id attribute to *link* a number of elements (the sections within our navbar) to specified IDs within the page using the skeleton code below. Also, check out an example [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_global_id_anchor).

```
  <a id="skills">This tag is the section you get to jump to! Skills is declared as the ID of this section.</a>

  <a href="#skills">This tag </a> denotes the link you click to jump back to the skills section! 
  If the "href" attribute is present, you've got yourself a link.```

Once you've finished this task, your page should look something like this.

<img src="images/html-page-3.png" alt="Example HTML in Browser with Picture and Menu Bar" style="height: 50%; width: 50%; border: solid;">

While your page may be short enough now that you don't need a navigation bar, this feature will prove indispensable when you generate more content and your single-page portfolio becomes increasingly difficult to walk through.
