  ### CSS: Clearly Stylish? Si.

  Now that we have a white-and-black form standing before us, it'd probably be in our best interest to clothe and align the poor thing. More than that, we want to make it the belle of the ball - would you rather engage the white t-shirt blue jeans flavor of your content or something wrapped in a Versace gown?

  **CSS** or **Cascading Style Sheets** allow you to swathe your humbly structured content in the vestments of your wildest dreams - as long as you know what you're doing. In taking down the analogy a notch, CSS also lets you do all the basic necessities of formatting a webpage: positioning elements, changing font and color, and adding spacing and borders between elements so that they don't cluster or overlap. 

  It probably goes without saying: if HTML is the skeletal structure of your webpage, CSS is the makeup, the clothing, the *aesthetic* of your site.
