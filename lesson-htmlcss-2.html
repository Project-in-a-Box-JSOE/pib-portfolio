  ## Structure, Style, Starter Code: Part Two

  ### CSS: Clearly Stylish? Si.

  Now that we have a white-and-black form standing before us, it'd probably be in our best interest to clothe and align the poor thing. More than that, we want to make it the belle of the ball - would you rather engage the white t-shirt blue jeans flavor of your content or something wrapped in a Versace gown?

  **CSS** or **Cascading Style Sheets** allow you to swathe your humbly structured content in the vestments of your wildest dreams - as long as you know what you're doing. In taking down the analogy a notch, CSS also lets you do all the basic necessities of formatting a webpage: positioning elements, changing font and color, and adding spacing and borders between elements so that they don't cluster or overlap. 

  It probably goes without saying: if HTML is the skeletal structure of your webpage, CSS is the makeup, the clothing, the *aesthetic* of your site.

  ####Lesson 2: Creating your Style

  First and foremost, CSS cannot exist without pre-existing HTML. All styling can only be applied to content that has already been surrounded with tags.

  There are three *selectors* CSS styling can be applied to:

  1. **element**: This is inclusive of all HTML tags such as &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt;. An example of this is as follows:

  ```
  p {
    color: red;
    text-align: center;
  } ```

  2. **id**: This selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The id of an element should be the only one of its kind on a page, so any styling applied to this selector can only be applied to one element. To select an element with a specific id, preface the id name with a hash (#) character.

  ```
  #para1 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }```

  3. **class**: This selector selects elements with a specific class attribute. The class of an element can be applied to any number of elements. To select elements with a specified class, preface the id name with a period (.) character.

  ```
  .center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }```

  Recalling *block* and *inline* elements from the previous HTML lesson, 




  It's nearly impossible to know every feasible CSS attribute and attribute value out there, but here's [a good reference that encompasses everything you need](https://www.onblastblog.com/css3-cheat-sheet/).
